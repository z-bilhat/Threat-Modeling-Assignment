User Interface (Front-end):
Login Page: This will be the entry point for users to authenticate themselves. It will have fields for the username and password and a button to submit the credentials.
Message-of-the-Day Display: Upon successful login, the user will be taken to a page where the message-of-the-day is displayed. This message is retrieved from the database.
Commenting Feature: Below the day's message, there will be a section for users to post comments. These comments will also be stored in the database associated with the user and the message.

Authentication Component:
Open Source Authentication Service: We can use an open-source authentication system like OAuth or an identity platform like Auth0 to handle user credential verification. This will interface with our user database to validate credentials.

Back-end Components:
User Management Module: Handles the creation of new user accounts, stores login credentials, and manages sessions. Passwords should be stored securely using hashing and salting techniques.
Message-of-the-Day Module: Retrieves the message-of-the-day from the database to be displayed to the user after they log in.
Comment Module: Handles storing user comments on the day's message in the database.

Database:
User Table: Stores user information and hashed passwords.
Messages Table: Stores messages of the day.
Comments Table: Stores user comments, along with a reference to the message and the user who commented.

Server and API:
Web Server: Handles HTTP requests and serves the front-end application.
Application Programming Interface (API): A RESTful API that facilitates communication between the front and back end. It will have endpoints for logging in, retrieving the day's message, and posting comments.

Security:
HTTPS: All communication between the client and server will be over HTTPS to ensure data is encrypted in transit.
Authentication Tokens: After login, users will receive a token (such as JWT) that must be sent with each subsequent request to access authorized endpoints.
Sample Architecture Flow:
User Registration and Login:
The user submits registration details through the UI.
The user management module creates a new user entry in the database.
For login, the user submits credentials via the UI.
The authentication component verifies credentials against the user table in the database.
A session token is generated and sent back to the UI upon successful authentication.
Message-of-the-Day Retrieval:
Once authenticated, the front end requests the message of the day from the API.
The message-of-the-day module fetches the message from the messages table in the database and returns it to the front end.
Commenting:
The user submits a comment through the UI.
The comment module takes the comment, associates it with the user's ID and the message ID, and stores it in the comments table in the database.
